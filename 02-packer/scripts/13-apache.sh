# Apache2

#
# Gives the agent somewhere to publish to. It can write a page into the
# document root with the exec tool and immediately open it in Chrome at
# http://localhost/, which makes "build me something and show me" a single
# self-contained demo needing no external hosting.
#
# The document root is world-writable so the agent can drop files there without
# sudo. That is a lab posture, not a production one: any local user can replace
# anything Apache serves. The tighter alternative is
# `chown -R openclaw:openclaw /var/www/html` with 775, which achieves the same
# thing for this one user — swap it in if this image is ever reused for
# anything real.
#
# Apache listens on :80, which is NOT open in the NSG or the subnet security
# list. That is deliberate: the page is reachable from the desktop's own
# browser and nothing else. Open 3389-style ingress for 80 in 01-core and
# 03-openclaw only if you want it published to the internet.
