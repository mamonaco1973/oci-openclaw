# The six Python libraries below come from apt, not pip. The base image

# then install over apt's copies and hit the RECORD conflict described
# below, once per package.

# Versions are pinned to a build verified working on 2026-09-05. Without
# pins pip resolves "newest on PyPI at build time", so an upstream release
# can break a build that changed nothing -- which is exactly how anyio
# 4.15 broke this script by requiring typing_extensions >= 4.16.
#
# typing_extensions is staged separately, first, with --ignore-installed:
# apt ships 4.10 with no RECORD file, so pip cannot uninstall it and aborts
# the whole transaction. Installing over it puts the new copy in /usr/local,
# which precedes dist-packages on sys.path, leaving apt's copy intact for
# Debian's own dependents. The flag is NOT used on the main install -- there
# it would stop apt-provided packages from satisfying transitive deps, so
# pip would pull unpinned copies of packaging, pillow, dateutil and pyparsing.
#
# To refresh: build an image, then on the host run
#   pip3 list --format=freeze --path /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages
# and paste the output into the heredoc below.
